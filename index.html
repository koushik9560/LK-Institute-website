                    The Admissions to various B.Tech. and 5-Year Integrated M.Tech. programmes of SASTRA (main Campus &
                    SRC) shall be done in the following way:
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong>Stream 1 – JEE-Main Score & Class XII Score</strong>
                    <br> <br>
                    Admission to 70% of seats shall be based on normalised aggregate Class XII Scores and available JEE
                    Main (2022) scores taken together with 50% weightage each. Seats shall be filled based on the Ranks
                    Secured by student.
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong>Stream 2 – Class XII Score</strong>
                    <br> <br>
                    Remaining 30% of seats shall be based on the normalised aggregate Class XII score awarded by the
                    respective boards. Rank list shall be prepared based on this aggregate score and admissions shall be
                    made based on the rank secured.
                    <br> <br>
                    All students shall be considered for both streams by default. If they haven’t written JEE, in Stream
                    1 there will be no weightage to that part and rank will be based on Class XII scores alone. JEE is
                    not mandatory.
                    <br> <br>
                    The allotment of seats to students completing schooling at Thanjavur & Trichy (20%), Tamilnadu, All
                    India (with reasonable cap for major States) remains unchanged with special provisions for NE States
                    and other special status States/UTs.
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong>For all PG programmes,</strong> admissions will be made on the basis of the scores in the
                    qualifying UG / PG degree programme. GATE qualified candidates will be given preference for
                    Engineering programmes and for MBA, students with good CAT / XAT / AIMAT / CMAT / AIMCAT scores will
                    be given preference.
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong>For all degree programmes in Law,</strong> admissions will be based on the CLAT 2022 Scores
                    and +2 aggregate taken in the ratio of 25% : 75% respectively.
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong>For all other degree programmes</strong> in Sciences, Arts, Commerce, Education, etc.,
                    admissions will be based on the qualifying exam marks.
                    <br> <br>
                    Please note that in the event of any changes and unreasonable delay in exams like JEE or CLAT beyond
                    manageable time, then the admission policy shall also be changed at the sole discretion of the
                    university’s competent authority to ensure that there is no collateral damage.
